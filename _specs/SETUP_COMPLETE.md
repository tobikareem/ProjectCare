### 📄 Templates Created

**1. REQUIREMENTS_TEMPLATE.md** (Tailored for CarePath Health)
- Problem statement
- User stories (Gherkin format: Given/When/Then)
- Functional & non-functional requirements
- Success criteria
- Security & HIPAA compliance considerations
- Service line considerations (In-Home Care vs Healthcare Staffing)

**2. DESIGN_TEMPLATE.md** (Tailored for .NET 9 Full Stack)
- Architecture overview (which layers affected)
- Domain layer: Entities, value objects, enums, interfaces
- Application layer: DTOs, services, validators, AutoMapper
- Infrastructure layer: EF Core configurations, repositories, migrations
- API layer: Controllers/Minimal APIs, SignalR hubs
- Presentation layer: .NET MAUI mobile + Blazor WebAssembly web
- Testing strategy (unit, integration, E2E)
- Deployment plan

**3. TASKS_TEMPLATE.md** (Atomic Task Breakdown)
- Tasks organized by phase (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API → UI → Testing → Deployment)
- Each task includes: ID, dependencies, estimate, success criteria, files to modify
- Progress tracking table
- Critical path analysis

### 🛠 Helper Scripts

**new-spec.sh**
- Creates all three spec files at once
- Auto-fills date, author, cross-links between specs
- Usage: `./scripts/new-spec.sh "Your Feature Name"`

---

## 🚀 Getting Started (Next Steps)

### Step 1: Read the Quick Start
```bash
cat _specs/QUICKSTART.md
```
OR open it in your editor to read the 5-minute guide.

### Step 2: Create Your First Spec
```bash
cd _specs
./scripts/new-spec.sh "GPS Check-In"
```

This creates:
- `01-requirements/gps-check-in.md`
- `02-design/gps-check-in.md`
- `03-tasks/gps-check-in.md`

### Step 3: Fill in the Requirements Spec
```bash
# Open in your editor
code 01-requirements/gps-check-in.md
# OR
vim 01-requirements/gps-check-in.md
```

Follow the template sections:
1. Problem statement
2. User stories
3. Functional requirements
4. Success criteria

### Step 4: Get Stakeholder Approval
- Share the requirements spec with Product Owner
- Gather feedback
- Update the spec
- Mark status as "Approved"

### Step 5: Fill in the Design Spec
- Reference `/Documentation/Architecture.md`
- Define entities, DTOs, services
- Plan EF Core migrations
- Design API endpoints
- Sketch UI components

### Step 6: Fill in the Tasks Spec
- Break design into atomic tasks (1-4 hours each)
- Define dependencies
- Estimate each task
- Organize by phase

### Step 7: Implement with Claude Code
```bash
# Option 1: Claude Code CLI
claude-code --spec _specs/03-tasks/gps-check-in.md

# Option 2: In Claude conversation
# "Please implement the feature defined in _specs/03-tasks/gps-check-in.md"
```

## 🎯 Why Use Spec-Driven Development?

### Traditional Workflow
```
You: "Build GPS check-in"
↓
Claude: "Should I use X or Y?"
↓
You: "Use X"
↓
Claude: "What about Z?"
↓
You: "Actually, use Y instead"
↓
(Repeat 20 times... ⏱️ lots of back-and-forth)
```

### Spec-Driven Workflow
```
You: Write specs (1-2 hours upfront)
↓
Get approval
↓
Claude: Reads specs and implements autonomously
↓
✅ Done! (No interruptions, correct the first time)
```

### Benefits
- ✅ **Fewer interruptions**: Decisions made upfront
- ✅ **Better quality**: Clear specifications to follow
- ✅ **Faster overall**: Less rework and back-and-forth
- ✅ **Better documentation**: Specs become permanent docs
- ✅ **Team alignment**: Everyone agrees before coding starts

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Requirements Specs
- Focus on the **problem**, not the solution
- Use **Gherkin format** for user stories (Given/When/Then)
- Include **quantitative metrics** (95% success rate, < 500ms)
- Consider **both service lines**: In-Home Care (40-45% margin) and Healthcare Staffing (25-30% margin)

### For Design Specs
- Always start with **which layers are affected**
- Follow **Clean Architecture** principles (Domain → Application → Infrastructure → API/UI)
- Plan **EF Core migrations** carefully (include rollback)
- Consider **SignalR** for real-time features
- Think about **offline mode** for mobile app (SQLite)

### For Tasks Specs
- Keep tasks **atomic** (1-4 hours each)
- Define **clear dependencies**
- Be **specific about files** to create/modify
- Write **testable success criteria**

## 🔗 CarePath Health Architecture Reference

Your specs should align with the CarePath Health architecture:

### Layers
1. **Domain** (`CarePath.Domain`) - Entities, value objects, interfaces
2. **Application** (`CarePath.Application`) - Services, DTOs, validators
3. **Infrastructure** (`CarePath.Infrastructure`) - EF Core, repositories
4. **API** (`WebApi`) - Controllers, SignalR hubs
5. **MAUI Mobile** (`CarePath.MauiApp`) - iOS/Android app
6. **Web Admin** (`CarePath.Web`) - Blazor WebAssembly dashboard

### Technology Stack
- .NET 9
- Entity Framework Core 9
- ASP.NET Core Identity (JWT)
- SignalR (real-time)
- .NET MAUI Blazor Hybrid (mobile)
- Blazor WebAssembly (web)
- SQL Server
- FluentValidation
- AutoMapper
- xUnit + Moq (testing)

## 📞 Need Help?

### Resources
- **Spec workflow questions**: Read `README.md`
- **CarePath architecture**: See `/Documentation/Architecture.md`
- **.NET 9 / EF Core**: Microsoft documentation
- **Claude Code**: Claude Code documentation

### Common Issues

**"My specs are too long!"**
→ That's okay! Better to be thorough. You can always split into multiple features.

**"I don't know how to fill in the design section"**
→ Reference `/Documentation/Architecture.md` and the template examples. Start with which layers are affected.

**"Claude is asking questions even with specs"**
→ Make sure specs include enough detail. If Claude asks, add that detail to the spec for future reference.
